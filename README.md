# Reinforcement learning Unique Card Swap Connect 4 Suits Game with An Awesome User Interface

# Suit Collector
Suit Collector is a two player which requires 16 cards from a deck of playing cards which are Ace, King, Queen, and Jack from each of the four suits’ namely, Clubs, Hearts, Spades and Diamonds. These 16 cards are shuffled and arranged in a 4x4 grid. See the image on right for an example. Please refer to previous tutorials for how this game is played. It is assumed that the reader understands the ‘Game Analysis’, ‘Solution Background’ sections from the previous tutorial ‘Raider_Squad_tutorial1_V1.docx’ and ‘Raider_Squad_tutorial2_V1.docx’. Further changes, problems encountered, papers and solutions and enhancements made are discussed as part of this tutorial

## Game 
As part of this tutorial, we have provided a versatile User Interface using which the User can interact with all the different agents in the Same UI, save and load different board states, Pick Suites based on Phase 1, method 1 and method 2 Technique, and Play the game and improve his/her game play by playing with different levels of challenging agents. However, more training time and iterations are required to improve the overall performance of the agents.

## Requirements
1.	Python (v3.9.16) programming language and windows (windows 11) platform.
2.	VS code (v1.77.3) for coding and debugging.
3.	Installation of Anaconda and the creation of a Python 3.9 Anaconda environment as per the Instructions steps available in ‘Example Run.docx - Installation Section’.
4.	Installation of the required packages: NumPy (v1.23.5), Gymnasium (v 0.27.1), TensorFlow (v 2.6.0) and Keras (2.6.0).
5.	Knowledge of the game Suit Collector, including the rules and the actions that the agent can take.
6.	Understanding the reinforcement learning concepts, including Markov Decision Processes, reward functions, and policy optimization.
7.	The knowledge of concepts adapted in our project such as Convolution Layers, Neural Networks, Deep learning, Epsilon Greedy, DQN, Experience Replay.
